# Snake Test

This is a simple program done for a company's selection process.

Taking the classic Snake game as a base, the test asks for an algorithm that, given a board with an x/y size, the position of the snake within said board, and a path depth, is able to return the amount of possible paths that the snake could take.

An interesting proposition and a pretty nice refresher by itself, it includes stuff like thread management and recursiveness. The explanation to most of the code, including classes, methods, and variables used, is located on a Javadoc within the "doc" folder.
